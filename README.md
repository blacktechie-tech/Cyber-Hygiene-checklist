# Cyber-Hygiene-checklist
This beginner-friendly web app helps users adopt safe cybersecurity habits by ticking off a checklist of best practices (e.g., using strong passwords, enabling 2FA).
I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” and added interactivity that counts how many steps the user has completed.

Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Focus: Cybersecurity education, frontend interaction
What I learned: DOM manipulation, UI structuring, and turning security principles into user-friendly tools.

# Why This Project Matters
Cybersecurity isnâ€™t only for professionals â€” everyday users face threats like phishing, weak passwords, and unsafe browsing habits. This app was created to help bridge the gap between technical knowledge and daily safe practices, especially for students, parents, and working professionals who need quick, clear guidance.
